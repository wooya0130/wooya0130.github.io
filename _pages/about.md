# About Me
👋 **Hello! I'm Jaewoo Ahn**  
I am currently a **Ph.D. candidate** in the **Control and Mechatronics Lab** at **Korea University**, under the supervision of Professor Myotaek Lim. 
In addition, I am a student researcher at the **Humanoid Robotics Lab** at the **Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST)**, where I am mentored by **Dr. Yonghwan Oh**, a Principal Research Scientist.
My research focuses on **robot control**, with a particular emphasis on **optimal control** and **hybrid control systems**. I am also exploring **reinforcement learning** to enhance the adaptability of robotic systems. My ultimate goal is to bridge the gap between simulation and real-world applications, enabling robots to perform complex tasks in dynamic environments.
